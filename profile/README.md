## 🐉 Welcome to the DragonMineZ Organization

We are the team behind **DragonMine Z**, an immersive Minecraft mod inspired by Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball universe, currently developed for Forge 1.20.1. 
Our focus is on building high-quality gameplay systems, thoughtful design, and tools that make the mod fun both in singleplayer and on dedicated servers.

In the future, we plan to evolve this organization into a proper **brand**, expanding beyond a single mod into a broader ecosystem of projects, tools, and community resources.
As we grow, this space will centralize our documentation, contribution guides, and any new experiments we launch.

### 👥 Core Team

- **Founders & Lead Developers** – Yuseix, ezShokkoh
- **Tech Lead & Developer** – KyoSleep
- **Developer & Community Admin** – Bruno

We also collaborate with contributors, artists, builders, translators, and community members who help shape the DragonMine Z experience.

### 🚀 What We’re Working On

- Maintaining and expanding the DragonMine Z mod (systems, balance, content updates).
- Improving documentation and contribution flows so new developers can onboard easily. 
- Laying the groundwork for future projects under a unified brand identity.
